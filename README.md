## Requirements

Create a simple todo-list application using Angular. Your application must:

- Allow users to create new todos in the UI.
- Allow users to mark todos as complete changing its color to green.
- Allow users to mark todos as “postpone” which will temporarily remove them from the list.
- Allow users to delete todos from the UI.
- Add a clean button that will remove the completed todos.
- Add a restore button that will bring back all the postponed todos.
- As a bonus, you may add an edit option if you like or work on the styling.
